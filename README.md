# telecom_churn_prediction
For the current project we use the churn database WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palashfendarkar/wa-fnusec-telcocustomerchurn 

Churn, also called attrition, is a term used usually to indicate a customer leaving the service of one company in favor of another company, 
not desired by the business owners. We use the Churn dataset to analyze the sample data to apply some descriptive statistics methods to find 
patterns and trend of churn, explore the data, the relations between predictor variables and the target variable, EDA, and other tasks such as 
prediction and classification using decision tree, logistic regression, na√Øve bayes methods.
all phases of data preparation, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling and evaluation may be carried out one-button.
the churn.py script includes comments about deifferent phases.
